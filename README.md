# HW2: Strategy Analysis
This Dash app contains the framework for a fully backtested and benchmarked trading strategy. To get it to work, you'll need to either have a Blomberg connection or put some OHLC data into a csv file named 'IVV US Equity.csv' located in a directory named 'bbg_data' within the project.

I will be updating this site and giving a demo tomorrow (Monday, 12 Apr) during office hours.
